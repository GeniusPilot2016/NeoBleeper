# NeoBleeper

NeoBleeper is a tune creation software using the system speaker on the motherboard, inspired by the Bleeper Music Maker software that Robbi-985 (aka SomethingUnreal) developed around 2007-2008 but abandoned in 2010 due to the fact that beeps were directed to the default sound device instead of the system speaker on the motherboard in Windows 7 and above. NeoBleeper provides a more stable music making experience by solving the problem of system beeps being directed to the speakers connected to the sound card instead of the system speaker on the motherboard in Windows 7 and above by accessing the physical port of the system speaker üñ•Ô∏èüé∂

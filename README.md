# NeoBleeper

NeoBleeper is a tune creation software using the system speaker on the motherboard, inspired by the Bleeper Music Maker software that Robbi-985 (aka SomethingUnreal) developed around late 2007-early 2008 but abandoned in 2010 due to the fact that beeps were directed to the default sound device instead of the system speaker on the motherboard in Windows 7 and above. NeoBleeper provides a more stable music making experience by solving the problem of system beeps being directed to the default sound device instead of the system speaker on the motherboard in Windows 7 and above by accessing the physical port of the system speaker 🖥️🎶

# NeoBleeper

NeoBleeper is an AI-enabled tune creation software using the system speaker (aka PC Speaker) on the motherboard, inspired by the Bleeper Music Maker software that Robbi-985 (aka SomethingUnreal) developed around late 2007-early 2008 but abandoned in 2011 due to the fact that beeps were directed to the default sound device instead of the system speaker on the motherboard in newer Windows versions. NeoBleeper provides a more stable music making experience by solving the problem of system beeps being directed to the default sound device instead of the system speaker on the motherboard in newer Windows versions by accessing the physical port of the system speaker 🖥️🎶

  - #### You can personalize as you wish

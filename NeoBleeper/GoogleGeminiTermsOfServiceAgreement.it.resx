    Microsoft ResX Schema

    Version 2.0

    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes
    associated with the data types.

    Example:

    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>

    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple
    name/value pairs.

    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture.
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the
    mimetype set.

    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:

    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can
    read any of the formats listed below.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Effective October 17, 2025

To use [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview),
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com), and the other Google developer
services that reference these terms (collectively, the "**APIs** " or
"**Services** "), you must accept (1) the
[Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms)
(the "**API Terms** "), and (2) these Gemini API Additional Terms of Service (the
"**Additional Terms**"). Terms that are not defined in these Additional Terms
have the meanings given in the API Terms.

## Age Requirements

You must be 18 years of age or older to use the APIs. You also will not use the
Services as part of a website, application, or other service (collectively,
"**API Clients**") that is directed towards or is likely to be accessed by
individuals under the age of 18.

## Use Restrictions

You may only access the Services (or make API Clients available to users) within
an [available region](https://ai.google.dev/available_regions). You may use only Paid Services when
making API Clients available to users in the European Economic Area,
Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.

You may not use the Services to develop models that compete with the Services
(e.g., Gemini API or Google AI Studio). You also may not attempt to reverse
engineer, extract or replicate any component of the Services, including the
underlying data or models (e.g., parameter weights).

In addition to the
"[API Prohibitions](https://developers.google.com/terms#a_api_prohibitions)"
section in the API Terms, you must comply with our
[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy),
which provides additional details about appropriate conduct when using the
Services.

The Services include safety features to block harmful content, such as content
that violates our
[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy).
You may not attempt to bypass these protective measures or use content that
violates the API Terms or these Additional Terms. You should only lower
[safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_setting_gemini) if necessary and appropriate for
your use case. Applications with less restrictive safety settings may be subject
to Google's review and approval.

You may not use the Services in clinical practice, to provide medical advice, or
in any manner that is overseen by or requires clearance or approval from a
medical device regulatory agency.

## Use of Generated Content

Some of our Services allow you to generate original content. Google won't claim
ownership over that content. You acknowledge that Google may generate the same
or similar content for others and that we reserve all rights to do so.

As required by the API Terms, you'll comply with applicable law in using
generated content, which may require the provision of
[attribution](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1beta/CitationMetadata) to your users when returned as
part of an API call. Use discretion before relying on generated content,
including [code](https://g.co/legal/generative-code). You're responsible for
your use of generated content, and for the use of that content by anyone you
share it with.

## Unpaid Services

Any Services that are offered free
of charge like direct interactions with Google AI Studio or unpaid quota in
Gemini API are unpaid Services (the "**Unpaid Services**").

### How Google Uses Your Data

When you use Unpaid Services, including, for example, Google AI Studio and the
unpaid quota on Gemini API, Google uses the content you submit to the Services
and any generated responses to provide, improve, and develop Google products and
services and machine learning technologies, including Google's enterprise
features, products, and services, consistent with our
[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

To help with quality and improve our products, human reviewers may read,
annotate, and process your API input and output. Google takes steps to protect
your privacy as part of this process. This includes disconnecting this data from
your Google Account, API key, and Cloud project before reviewers see or annotate
it. **Do not submit sensitive, confidential, or personal information to the
Unpaid Services.**

The license you grant to Google under the
"[Submission of Content](https://developers.google.com/terms#b_submission_of_content)"
section in the API Terms also extends, to the extent required under applicable
law for our use, to any content (e.g., prompts, including associated system
instructions, cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents)
you submit to the Services and to any generated responses.

Google only uses content that you import or upload to our model tuning feature
for that express purpose. Tuning content may be retained in connection with your
tuned models for purposes of re-tuning when supported models change. When you
delete a tuned model, the related tuning content is also deleted.

If you're in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, the
terms under "[How Google uses Your Data](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#data-use-paid)" in
"[Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)" apply to all Services, including Google AI
Studio and unpaid quota in the Gemini API, even though they are offered free of
charge.

## Paid Services

When a Service is being offered for a fee, it is considered to be a paid Service
(the "**Paid Services** "). When you activate a [Cloud Billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts),
all use of Gemini API and Google AI Studio is a "Paid Service" with respect to
how Google Uses Your Data, even when using Services that are offered free of
charge, such as Google AI Studio and unpaid quota of Gemini API.

For Paid Services, "Google" as used in these
Terms has the meaning given
[here](https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity).

### How Google Uses Your Data

When you use Paid Services, including, for example, the paid quota of the Gemini
API, Google doesn't use your prompts (including associated system instructions,
cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents) or responses to
improve our products, and will process your prompts and responses in accordance
with the
[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).
For Paid Services, Google logs prompts and responses for a limited period of
time, solely for the purpose of detecting violations of the
[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy)
and any required legal or regulatory disclosures. This data may be stored
transiently or cached in any country in which Google or its agents maintain
facilities.

Other data we collect while providing the Paid Services to you, such as account
information and settings, billing history, direct communications and feedback,
and usage details (e.g., information about usage including token count per
prompt and response, operational status, safety filter triggers, software errors
and crash reports, authentication details, quality and performance metrics, and
other technical details necessary for Google to operate and maintain Services,
which may include device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens, and IP
addresses) remains subject to the
[Google Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms](https://business.safety.google/controllerterms/)
and
[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) referenced in the
API Terms.

When using Grounding with Google Search, additional data is collected and used,
as detailed in the
"[Grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#grounding-with-google-search)" section below.

### Payment Terms

Billing and payments for Paid Services are handled by
[Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts) in the Google
Cloud Platform.

As such, Section 2 (Payment Terms) and Section 14 (Miscellaneous) of the
[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms) govern
payments, invoicing, billing, payment disputes, and related issues, while these
Terms govern your use of the Paid Services. These Terms do not govern your
direct use of any Google Cloud Platform service (including those listed on the
[Google Cloud Platform Services Summary](https://cloud.google.com/terms/services)).

"**Fees** " (as used in the
[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)) for
Paid Services are as specified on our [pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) page. Google may make
changes to this pricing from time to time, effective 30 days after they are
posted unless otherwise specified (or in the case of new Paid Services, where
pricing takes effect immediately unless otherwise specified). Your continued
use of the Paid Services constitutes your consent to those changes.

## Agentic Services

When using agentic services, including the Computer Use API, you are solely
responsible for the actions and tasks performed by the service, such as
determining whether the service is appropriate for your use case, authorizing
the service's access and connection to data, applications, and systems, and
exercising judgment and supervision when and if the service is used in
production environments. You will not automatically bypass any requests for
human confirmation.

## Grounding with Google Search​​

"Grounding with Google Search" is a Service that provides Grounded Results and
Search Suggestions and can be used through Google AI Studio (as an Unpaid
Service), and via Gemini API as a (Paid Service). "Grounded Results" mean
responses that Google generates using the prompt from the end user, (or from
you, when using function calling), contextual
information that you may provide (as applicable), and results from Google's
search engine. "Search Suggestions" (also known as Search Entry Points) mean
search suggestions that Google provides with the Grounded Results. If a Grounded
Result is clicked on, separate terms (not these terms) govern the destination
page. If a Search Suggestion is clicked on the
[Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) govern the
[google.com](http://google.com) destination page. "Links" are any other means to
fetch web pages (including hyperlinks and URLs), which may be contained in a
Grounded Result or Search Suggestion. Links also include titles or labels
provided with those means to fetch web pages. Excluding your web domain(s), you
will not assert ownership rights in any intellectual property in Search
Suggestions or Links in Grounded Results.

### Use Restrictions

- You will only use Grounding with Google Search in an application that is owned and operated by you and will only display the Grounded Results with the associated Search Suggestion(s) to the end user who submitted the prompt.
- You will not, and will not allow your end user or any third party to, cache, copy, frame, syndicate, resell, analyze, train on, or otherwise learn from Grounded Results or Search Suggestions. For clarity, Grounded Results, Search Suggestions, and Links are intended to be used in combination to respond to a given End User prompt and it is a violation of these terms to use Grounding with Google Search to extract or collect one or more of these components for another purpose (for example, using programmatic or automated means to collect Links, using Links to build an index, or using Links to identify destination pages for crawling or scraping).
- You will not, and will not allow your end user or any third party to, store, or implement any click tracking, Link-tracking or other monitoring of Grounded Results or Search Suggestions, except that:
  - You may store the text of the Grounded Result(s) (excluding Links): (1) that were displayed by you for up to thirty (30) days only to evaluate and optimize the display of the Grounded Results in your application; (2) in chat history of an end user of your application for up to six (6) months only for the purpose of allowing that end user to view their chat history; and (3) temporarily for the purpose of resubmitting the text of the Grounded Result in a subsequent prompt that you submit to Google via a function call to obtain a refined or improved Grounded Result to display to the End User, as long as the developer: (i) does not use the interim Grounded Results for any other purpose; (ii) deletes any Grounded Result that is not displayed to the End User once the final Grounded Result is generated; and (iii) displays any associated Search Suggestions or other Links (as applicable) with the final Grounded Result (up to a maximum of 5 Search Suggestions) to the End User.
  - You may monitor end user interactions with your application interface; however, you will not track whether those interactions were specifically with a given Search Suggestion or Grounded Result (in each case, in whole or in part, including any specific Link).
- Unless permitted by Google in writing, you: (1) will not modify, or intersperse any other content with, the Grounded Results or Search Suggestions; and (2) will not place any interstitial content between any Link or Search Suggestions and the associated destination page, redirect end users away from the destination pages, or minimize, remove, or otherwise inhibit the full and complete display of any destination page.

### Data Collection and How Google Uses Your Data

In addition to the general terms above ("How Google Uses Your Data" under
"[Unpaid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#unpaid-services)" and "[Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)"),
when using Grounding with Google Search,
Google will store prompts, contextual information that you may provide, and
output for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating Grounded Results and
Search Suggestions and the stored information can be used for debugging and
testing of systems that support Grounding with Google Search. When using
Grounding with Google Search via paid quota of Gemini API, this processing for
debugging and testing of systems is in accordance with the
[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).

This subsection "Grounding with Google Search" will survive termination of the
Agreement, as applicable.

The
[Client Application Guidelines](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10926790)
apply to your use of Grounding with Google Search. For purposes of the Client
Application Guidelines, your applications that are using Grounding with Google
Search are considered Approved Applications.

## Grounding with Google Maps

"Grounding with Google Maps" is a Service that provides Google Maps Grounded
Results as a feature of Gemini API. "Google Maps Grounded Results" mean
responses that Google generates using Google Maps Data in response to an end
user initiated prompt. "Google Maps Data" means the content originating from
Google Maps in the Google Maps Grounded Results, including in the output text,
in the metadata of the Google Maps Grounded Results, in the Google Maps Links,
and content accessed through Google Maps Links. "Google Maps Links" mean the
URLs that Google provides in a Google Maps Grounded Result and any titles or
labels provided with those URLs. If Google Maps Links are clicked on, these
separate [Google Maps End User Terms](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html)
and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) govern the
destination page. Google Maps Data in the text of a Google Maps Grounded Result
will be identified via the Google Maps Links. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Agreement, Google and its content providers retain all rights to
Google Maps Data.

### Use restrictions

1. You will only use Grounding with Google Maps in an application that is owned and
   operated by you and will only use Grounding with Google Maps to display the
   Google Maps Grounded Results with the associated Google Maps Links to the
   end user who initiated the prompt. An end user is an individual you permit
   to use your application.

2. You will not modify the Google Maps Grounded Result or intersperse any other
   content with the Google Maps Grounded Result, place any interstitial content
   between the text of the Google Maps Grounded Result and the Google Maps
   Links or the Google Maps Links and the associated destination page, or
   redirect end users away from the destination pages or minimize, remove, or
   otherwise inhibit the full and complete display of any destination page.

3. You will comply with the Documentation for Grounding with Google Maps.

4. You will not, and will not allow your end users or any third party to:

   1. cache or store Google Maps Grounded Results except that you may cache or
      store Google Maps Grounded Results:

      1. for up to ninety (90) days, only to evaluate and optimize the display of the
         Google Maps Grounded Results for your application; or,

      2. in the chat history of an end user in your application for up to six (6)
         months for the purpose of allowing that end user to view their chat history or
         to maintain prior conversation context for that end user within your application
         (Section 4 (a) overrides any cache header);

   2. scrape or export any Google Maps Data;

   3. train on any Google Maps Data; or

   4. distribute or market any Customer Applications in any Prohibited Territory
      as defined in the Documentation.

### Data Collection and How Google Uses Your Data

You acknowledge that it is reasonably
necessary for Google to store prompts, contextual information that you may
provide, and generated content for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating
Google Maps Grounded Results, and since such information is being stored, you
instruct Google that the stored information can be used for debugging and
testing of systems that support Grounding with Google Maps. When using Grounding
with Google Maps via paid quota of Gemini API, this processing for debugging and
testing of systems is in accordance with the [Data Processing Addendum for
Products Where Google is a Data
Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).

This subsection "Grounding with Google Maps" will survive termination of the
Agreement, as applicable.

## Hardware Safety

The following additional terms apply to models that can be used to control
robots or other robotic hardware ("**Robotics Models**").

You acknowledge and agree that the Robotics Models have not been tested with all
makes and models of robotics hardware, and therefore, that the performance and
safety of the Robotics Models in connection with your hardware is not guaranteed
or provided with a warranty of any kind. You therefore agree to operate any
hardware or other products that you may use in connection with the Robotics
Models in a safe manner, and completely at your own risk. The Robotics Models
may act in an unpredictable or unexpected manner when used in connection with
robotics hardware. You therefore agree to use discretion before using the
Robotics Models in a production, commercial, or public environment, and to not
use the Robotics Models for safety-critical applications or work, such as in the
following settings: (i) healthcare, (ii) transportation, or (iii) other areas
where safety protocols are vital, and a malfunction could reasonably foreseeably
lead to death, personal injury, or property damage.
